# Programming 3 - Sisu Project
This program was completed with a group of 3: Ville Niemi, Ronja Lipsonen and Onni Meril√§.
The main functionality of this program is to function as a student register by fetching information from Sisu API and using that to develop a graphic user interface for the user to handle.  
# Overall functionality
- Reads information from API and stores it to database.
- Uses this information to show courses from a certain degree or possibly look up on different courses on different degrees
- User can add new students or log in to available users and modify their courses
- Program can calculate average grade from the courses and progress bar to show the students progress on that certain degree
- When closed, the program saves the current students ArrayList to a datafile which is read when launching the program
