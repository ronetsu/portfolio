User is given the option to choose a location and what kind of data they want to see in a desired timeline.
User can also save data to their computer and download it into files. 
User can also combine different types of data and compare it to different data types.
The application contains a preferences page that allows to choose preferences and can be switched with a reset to the program to allow you

The app is simple. First of all it is important to choose a desired location. You can choose a certain area from the map or choose a area
predefined to the map. After choosen location remember to press add on map. After that you will notice icons on the top of the page.
