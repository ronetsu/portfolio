# Software design
## This folder contains the files for a group project course named Software Design. The project was made by me and three of my school friends. I was in charge of the UX side. So the overall design and color scheme was designed by me. 

The purpose of this project was to create a data-heavy program and the data was meant to be combined in many ways.
