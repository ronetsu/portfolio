        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Ronja Lipsonen and I am a student at the University of Tampere. I am studying computer science and I am currently taking the course ACC.180.
            I want to create a real website for me and I decided to use this course as an opportunity to do so. I am excited to learn more about HTML and CSS and to create a website that I can be proud of.</p>
